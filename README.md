# OpenMP-LBP-Implementation-for-Face-Similarity
Implemented Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithm for face similarity detection using OpenMP parallelization in C.  Compared sequential and parallel execution times to demonstrate performance improvement across multiple processors.  Designed an interactive web UI (HTML, CSS, Flask) for image upload and mode selection (Sequential vs Parallel).
